	<p>The song "Di Ka Sayang" by Ben&Ben explores themes of self-acceptance and self-love. 
	It encourages listeners to embrace their individuality and recognize their worth, despite any judgment from others. 
	The lyrics convey a message of comfort and hope, assuring that everyone deserves love and acceptance, especially from themselves. 
	The song's chorus, which translates to "You are not worthless," 
	serves as a powerful affirmation of self-love and encourages listeners to challenge negative self-perceptions.</p>
